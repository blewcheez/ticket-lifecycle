<h1>osTicket - Day in the Life </h1>
Here's a quick demonstration of how the average day would go<br />


<h2>Timmy the support agent would login to his osTicket</h2>

<h3> His department is pretty slow today, so he's waiting on some tickets. <h3/> 
<br> 
<br /> 
<h2> Lets check on Jimmy the system admin and see how his department is doing.</h2>

<h1> Looks like Jimmy has tickets to resolve by order of importance!</h1>

  And that's just what he does. Solving tickets with empathy and understanding. Great job Jimmy!
<br> 
  <br/> 

This would be a regular day. If some tickets end up being more urgent than others or if they require another deparmentment, the ticket would then be reassigned to that deparment.
